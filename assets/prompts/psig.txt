Construct a detailed theory of change for the following project, based on what you know about how to construct theories of change in international development.
The project is based on the theory that microfinance services will not expand rapidly in the poorest
states in the absence of catalytic donor support; and that provision of microfinance services reduces
the cost of borrowing money from informal moneylenders, protects poor people from shocks that will
otherwise push them into poverty and enables them to improve incomes and assets.
The second theory informing the project is that micro finance programmes can be leveraged to
empower women (economically and socially). It offers an opportunity to organise women in huge
numbers. By coming together and becoming part of a collective, women gain self-esteem and
respect within their families and learn to take independent decisions. Providing women with access
to financial products and services as well as information and knowledge on social issues including
health, nutrition and their rights, helps reverse their lack of power and build their autonomy.
B. Impact and Outcome
The expected impact of the PSIG is ‘Poor and vulnerable people, especially women, in the low
income states benefit from economic growth through enhanced private investment and better
access to financial services’. This will be measured by tracking household income and levels of
empowerment amongst women supported by the project.
The key outcomes of the programme are:
• increased access of poor people, especially women, to financial services; (the total number of
clients reached will be 12 million over the base year. Approximately 70% of the clients will be
poor or borderline poor (below $2 a day);
• enhanced economic value generated for poor people by investments in enterprises
• enhanced decision making power for women.
PSIG will also deliver:
• Improved regulations and policy support at state and national levels so that new products and
institutions, catering to the needs of the poor in a responsible manner can be established and
become financially sustainable;
• Establishment and expansion of new institutions and models that provide poor people especially
women, with facilities for savings, loans, insurance and other services in a cost effective manner;
• Establishment or growth of private sector entities that benefit the poor as producers, skill
providers and consumers;
• Improved awareness among women of their rights, including as consumers of financial services,
improved financial literacy; and improved information on social and health issues.
